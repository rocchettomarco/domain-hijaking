## REXASI-PRO domain has been hijacked!

The REXASI-PRO official webpage is hosted by one of the partners to guarantee a longer availability of the website.  We decided to register this domain to ***raise awareness on domain hijacking***. No one have been hacked here ;) and no one can abuse the **.eu** domain!

You can visit the real [**REXASI-PRO website**](https://rexasi-pro.spindoxlabs.com/).

## What is *Domain Hijacking* ?

> *Domain hijacking*, also known as domain theft, involves illicitly altering the registration of a domain name without the consent of its original registrant or through the misuse of privileges within domain hosting and registrar software systems.

You can learn more about domain hijacking on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hijacking).
