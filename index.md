## Rexasi-Pro domain has been hijacked!
## What is *Domain Hijacking* ?

> *Domain hijacking*, also known as domain theft, involves illicitly altering the registration of a domain name without the consent of its original registrant or through the misuse of privileges within domain hosting and registrar software systems.

> This *malicious* act can have severe consequences for the rightful domain owner, not only in financial terms due to potential loss of commercial income generated from a website hosted on the domain or business conducted through the domain's email accounts but also in terms of readership and audience.

You can learn more about domain hijacking on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hijacking).

Or you can easily visit the real [**Rexasi-Pro website**](https://rexasi-pro.spindoxlabs.com/) ;)
