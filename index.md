## REXASI-PRO domain has been hijacked!

The REXASI-PRO official webpage is hosted by one of the partners to guarantee a longer availability of the website. We decided to register this domain to ***raise awareness on domain hijacking***. No one has been hacked here ;) and no one can abuse the rexasi-pro.eu domain!

You can visit the real **REXASI-PRO website [HERE](https://rexasi-pro.spindoxlabs.com/)**.

## What is *Domain Hijacking* ?

> *Domain hijacking*, also known as domain theft, involves illicitly altering the registration of a domain name without the consent of its original registrant or through the misuse of privileges within domain hosting and registrar software systems. After a successful hijacking, the hijacker can use the domain name to facilitate other illegal activity such as phishing, where a website is replaced by an identical website that records private information such as log-in passwords, spam, or may distribute malware from the perceived "trusted" domain.

You can learn more about domain hijacking on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hijacking).
