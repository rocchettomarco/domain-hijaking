## REXASI-PRO domain has been hijacked!

REXASI-PRO opted not to acquire this web domain, so *V-Research* - one of the partners - launched this website dedicated to ***raising awareness about domain hijacking*** and no one have been hacked here ;)

You can visit the real [**REXASI-PRO website**](https://rexasi-pro.spindoxlabs.com/).

## What is *Domain Hijacking* ?

> *Domain hijacking*, also known as domain theft, involves illicitly altering the registration of a domain name without the consent of its original registrant or through the misuse of privileges within domain hosting and registrar software systems.

You can learn more about domain hijacking on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hijacking).
